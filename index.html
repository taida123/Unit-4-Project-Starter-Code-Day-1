        <p>His family was attacked by demons and only two members survive - Tanjiro and his sister Nezuko, who is slowly turning into a demon. Tanjiro sets out to become a demon slayer to avenge his family and cure his sister.
</p>
        <p>Tanjiro comes from a family that sells coal and lives on a monutain. 
</p>
        <p>Tanjiro was 13 at the start of the anime but after 2 years of training to become a demon slayer he is now 15. 
</p>
        <p>Tanjiro has a keen nose that allows him to get a lay of the land and identify threats with a single whiff.
</p>
        <p>It is no surprise that he empathizes with anyone, even demons, which often makes him hesitate before delivering the final blow.
 
</p>
        <p>He can't keep a Straight Face when he lies, he is honest with anyone. It may be hard for him to foul anyone when he canâ€™t lie.
